# Auto-convert-pdfs-2-html-and-display

The code while running, constantly watches a directory (pdfs) for constant updates. When a new pdf file is added, it uses pdf2html tool to convert pdfs to html.

PDF2HTMLDisplaySimple directory separately provides code to display converted pdfs (stored in PDFs directory).

The two directories ("pdfs" and "PDFs") in above two separate codes will be at a later stage merged into one.

Final outcome will be:
Any new pdf added to the "pdfs" directory will be converted to html and the html (by selection in dialog box) will be visualized in a simple display.
